# XSWA-Practice
This HTML is used to practice how fast you press keys (F, E, R, T, G) randomly. It is useful for improving agility and reaction. Inspired by CHAIN ​​ROBLOX's XSAW, it is not intended to be an improvement or replacement, but rather a tribute and reinterpretation without comparison or competition.
